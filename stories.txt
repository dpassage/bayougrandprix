x As an admin, I want to create a new season.

x I create the season, giving it a name and selecting a scoring scheme.
X I then add drivers as entrants, with teams.
I can go directly to the driver, player, and team management pages from here.

I then add a race to the season.
For the race, I add some of the drivers as entrants.
After the race is over, I can place the entrants in order of finish, as well 
as qualifying finish.
