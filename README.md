# Bayou Grand Prix

This project exists for two purposes. Mostly, it's so I can play with Ruby on Rails and
get back into coding after a long professional layoff.

But it's also to keep scores, writeups, etc for the Bayou Grand Prix, a casual gaming
racing league for Formula DÃ©. Entirely frivolous, but ends up requiring a bunch of complex
model dependencies. And the backend stuff is my strength - I'm pretty bad at designing UI.
