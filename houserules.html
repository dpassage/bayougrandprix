      <li>Season and championships</li>

    <ol>

      <li>
	A season consists of twelve races. Tracks are generally chosen
	from among those used by the actual Formula One racing circuit
	and raced in the order in which they are raced in the Formula
	One season, although not all Formula One tracks will be
	raced. Exceptions may be made by common consensus.  The
	selection of tracks is made before the beginning of the
	season.
      </li>

      <li>
	Each race, points are awarded to the top eight finishers as follows:

	Drivers also earn points for their team. Drivers who do not
	finish the race earn no points.
      </li>

      <li>
	If a driver cannot make a particular race, he may nominate a
	replacement.  The replacement driver earns team points for the
	team of the driver he replaces, but earns driver points for
	himself.
      </li>

      <li>
	An entry fee of $3 is charged per driver at the beginning of each
	race. This money is used to purchase prizes.
      </li>

      <li>
	At the end of the season, the Driver's Championship is awarded
	to the driver who has accumulated the most points, and the
	Constructor's Championship to the team which has accumulated
	the most points. Ties are broken as in the offical Formula One
	championship: total race wins, total 2nd place finishes, total
	3rd place finishes, and so on, followed by total pole
	positions, total 2nd place starts, and so on.
      </li>

      <li>
	The winner of each race also receives an award.
      </li>

      <li>
	The Worst Driver award is awarded to the driver who
	accumulated the fewest points while starting at least half the
	races in the season.
      </li>

      <li>The Most Consistent Driver award is awarded to the driver
	who averaged the most points per start, while starting at least
	25% of the races in the season. It is not awarded if this driver
	also won the Driver's Championship.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <li>Teams</li>

    <ol>

      <li>
	Teams consist of two players, each controlling a single car
	and driver.  The default number of teams is five. If there are
	an odd number of players wishing to participate in the league
	at the beginning of the season, the players may by common
	consensus allow one player to drive without a team as a
	"rogue" driver.  
      </li> 

      <li>
	At the beginning of each season, teams are determined by the
	finish of the individual drivers from the previous season. The
	top five finishers each become captain of a new team. They are
	matched with the next five finishers in order, so that 1st
	place matches with 6th place, 2nd place matches with 7th
	place, and so on. If there are more or fewer than five teams,
	adjust accordingly. Ties are broken as specified for the
	Driver's Championship.
      </li>

      <li>Drivers who did not participate in the previous season are
	ranked by career points earned. New drivers receive the lowest
	rankings, and are seeded by random selection.
      </li>

      <li>A team captain in the new season who was a team captain in the
	previous season may keep his team's name and colors.  Otherwise,
	colors and team names are chosen in order of captain's finish in
	the previous season.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <li>Race rules</li>

    <ol>

      <li>
	Races are run by the English translation of the rules for the
	2002 Master's event, with changes as noted below. In case of a
	dispute, the first source of clarification is the written
	rules, then these clarifications and additions, then common
	consensus among the drivers present.
      </li>

      <li>Changes to Master's rules:
	<ol>

	  <li value="1"> Time Trials<br />
	    Time trials are run in order of finish in the previous race,
	    and then by total points in the season. For the first race of
	    the season, they are run in order of the driver ranking used
	    to assign teams. A driver may not receive tactical guidance
	    from any person while running his time trial, but any person
	    present may point out errors made in car movement. A driver
	    may not be timed by a member of his own team. Drivers may use
	    both hands.
	  </li>

	  <li value="14"> Collision<br /> 
	    Collisions with a car which has stalled at the start 
	    are not considered "aggravated."
	  </li>

	  <li value="19">Pit Stops and Order of Play<br />
	    <ol>

	      <li value="1">
		A driver in pit lane who rolls a 20 or 30 does not
		subject other drivers on the track to engine checks,
		but does cause a variable weather roll.
	      </li>

	      <li value="5">
		Order of play is determined by the normal rules.
	      </li>

	    </ol>

	  </li>

	</ol>

      </li>

      <li>Other rules
	<ol>

	  <li>
	    Drivers are discouraged from giving gameplay guidance to any
	    driver not on his own team. A driver may ask that other
	    conversations stop while making his move.
	  </li>

	  <li>A car which has finished the race is removed from the track
	    immediately, and may not be slipstreamed.
	  </li>

	  <li>If, as a result of a die roll, one or more cars is forced
	    completely out of the space it occupies on the board, the player
	    rolling the die is fined $1 per car. This money is placed in the
	    prize fund.
	  </li>

	</ol>
